# Test Plan

### Emma Nickel

## The types of testing required
- Automated (Class getters, setters, methods)
- Manual (Command-line functions)
## Software required to perform testing
- Jest npm package (tool/framework)
- Jest-Junit for reporting purposes
## Data structures required during testing
## Test cases, which should include
- User requirement being tested
- Inputs required to test functionality
- Expected outcome of the test

**A good test plan will include:**
- at least three test case design techniques, (base, edge, corner)
- be compliant with all organisational requirements
- and implement industry best practices.
